Iâ€™m Ahmad, a writer obsessed with technology, the internet and people.

Over the past 4 years, I have learned the ability to program systems. My expertise lie in everything web dev, mobile dev, systems - you name it. I have been putting these skills to use in helping a diverse client base in resolving their problems. Particularly, I specialize in creating systems that ultimately bring more users to your business.

Alongside Software engineering, I am expanding my skillset into hardware with an Electrical Engineering BSc. degree at LUT, Finland.

My interests lie in coming up with solutions to complex practical problems. I like to systemize and come up with optimal solutions to problems.

On the side, I enjoy taking a break every once in a while and going outside.`;

What about you? Have you got a story or a project to share? I'm down to hear it. Feel free to reach out or book a call ðŸ“†`;
